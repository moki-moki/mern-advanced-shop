# react-advanced-shop
My personal project meant to replicate an online shop. It has authentication, user permissions, CRUD operations, etc...

# TODO:
- [x] Delete product on front end as admin
- [x] Improve a little bit styling on landing page
- [ ] Improve Error Checking
- [ ] Add real time data transactiong for CRUD operations with socket.io
- [ ] Host it
